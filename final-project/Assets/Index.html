        4. basic about section -About our organization ADL. ADL’s beliefs are that while a dog’s love isn’t false, they may still have ulterior motives baked into them. however as long as you show love to your dog, the being they become will be pure. **Part about beings before becoming dogs** . A part of the being’s punishment is the short lifespan compared to humans, but when a dog passes it starts the journey of puppyhood anew, and when a dog has found true happiness throughout all its lifes it ascends, that being our leaders’ gospel.

        5. Memorial is the page dedicated to the leader 'my dog' he will have his own page and pictures of him will be edited accordingly. I’ll give him quotes that sound profound and his goal due to the love shown to him by his owner. He wants to move to a future where all people could share the type of bond he has. Whether or not the creator(of ADL) is doing this out of malice considering all the monetization like the toys, memberships and quotes are a mystery. 
    </p>
    <p>   
        6. If I can, I want to make up testimonials. 
        This can be used as 'research' 
        I'll ask people for pictures of their dogs, ask them to write something about their dog showing signs of being close to evolving basically like any quirk at all. Then acting as one of the cult leaders I write some type of prophecy about the dog.

         I probably won't use video or audio in this project

         membership will be paying and sending a picture and description of their dog

         The site will have monetization like membership tiers where at certain tiers they allow you to send in pictures of your dog to see how close it is to ascending, members only events, “Special dog toys” and special programs that say they stimulate a dogs’ mind and bring their evolution closer.

    </p>
    <p>
         call to action will be a final prophecy the leader.
