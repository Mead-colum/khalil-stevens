    <p> The fictitious truth I plan to use for my project is this
        All dogs are reincarnated primordial beings and they were made to take this form as punishment for the mistake of wiping the dinosaurs as they fought for the earth. In the aftermath all the beings agreed they would wipe their memories and cast themselves down to live among the animals left, however the instinct to grow and evolve stayed present. 
        Humans ‘quickly’ became the dominant species on earth so the reason dogs have become so personable to humans is that dogs assumed it would eventually lead to their freedom and/ or evolution. The reason I’m interested in a story like this is because I love dogs and I thought it’d be a fun idea I could incorporate my dog, and maybe other people’s dogs into.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Group, A.D.L (A Dog’s Love) Centers around a dog who ascends and has their owner create this website on their behalf to spread the word. ADL loves dogs and hopes to welcome our new ascended companions into a world where they can help us learn to be at peace with one another. As there aren’t many studies around a topic that doesn’t exist I plan to twist dog myths/ quirks and studies to fit the narrative of dogs being ready to evolve or have always acted in a way that seems like they know more than they do. 
    </p>
    <p>   
        If I can, I want to have classmates make up testimonials. I'll ask classmates for pictures of their dogs, ask them to write something about their dog showing signs of being close to evolving basically like any quirk at all. Then acting as one of the cult leaders I write some type of prophecy about the dog. Then I’ll have stuff like Exercises or schedules that are supposed to help your dog along its journey. In the same vein the site will have monetization like membership tiers where at certain tiers they allow you to send in pictures of your dog to see how close it is to ascending, members only events, “Special dog toys” and special programs that say they stimulate a dogs’ mind and bring their evolution closer.
    </p>  
    <p>   
        ADL’s beliefs are that A dog’s love isn’t false, they may still have ulterior motives baked into them ‘aka the thing about them being so personable’.but as long as you show love to your dog, the being they become will be pure. They say part of the being’s punishment is the short lifespan compared to humans, but when a dog passes it starts the journey of puppyhood anew, and when a dog has found true happiness throughout all its lifes it ascends, that being our leaders’ gospel. 
    </p>
    <P>
        The Leader is an evolved dog (my dog) and he will have his own page and pictures of him will be edited accordingly. I’ll give him quotes that sound profound and his goal due to the love shown to him by his owner. He wants to move to a future where all people could share the type of bond he has. Whether or not the creator(of ADL) is doing this out of malice considering all the monetization like the toys, memberships and quotes are a mystery. 
        The tone will be serious like, The writer believes everything written on every page and expects others to believe that he is the mouthpiece for the leader(a dog). It will be condescending to those who haven’t decided to believe in the ascension of dogs but overall it’ll carry an unstated message of loving your dogs for their quirks.
