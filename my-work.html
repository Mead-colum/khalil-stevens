			<p>This's a ScreenShot from a text based game. This game had 5 randomly generated locations each with a pre-generated item, quest and character. The player goes through each area and searches for an item that'll be given to a character to satisfy them in each zone. Character's dialouge is pulled from an external text file and cycled through by methods that pick the appropriate lines. There are climates that prevent the player from entering them without the proper equipment. equipment, found much like items and can be equipped via the inventory. The game is ended when the player satisfies all npcs which prompts them to return to the main menu. </p>

				<p>This's a ScreenShot from a game built using WPF. This features game had 6 locations each with a pre-generated item, quest and character. Each location and character generated has a unique photo and dialouge is pulled from an external text file. The main method of advancement are buttons that read the input box (that only allows numbers) and the enter key (which is only valid when a confirm button is on screen). The game is over when all desired items are collected  </p>
